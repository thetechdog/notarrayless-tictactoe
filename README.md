# NotArrayless Tic-Tac-Toe (NA-TTT for short)
"I can't believe it's Not Arrayless Tic-Tac-Toe"
# What is it?
A 2 player Tic-Tac-Toe command line game written in Java. Players can input their names at the start of the game.  
With version 2.0 the code got a rewrite to make it tidy and (hopefully) more efficient.  
As well as to not rely on Swing (which was dumb) and to handle exceptions and invalid coordinates without just ending the game.   
I would say that right now it's a pretty robust Tic-Tac-Toe game. There is no computer player, but it could be added at some point.
# Why the name?
Because unlike my other project, this one is not arrayless. Which means that it does use arrays.  
It uses a 3x3 bidimensional array to simulate the game's grid.  
And for some reason I think it's funny... That's about it.
