# NotArrayless Tic-Tac-Toe
"I can't believe it's Not Arrayless Tic-Tac-Toe"
# What is it?
A 2 player Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Java. It's mostly a terminal game, but it does use swing for some stuff that can easily be replaced to 
make it a fully fledged terminal game. It is also more or less a Java version of my older project, Arrayless Tic-Tac-Toe.
# Why the name?
Because unlike my other project, this one is not arrayless. Which means that it does use arrays.
It uses a two-dimensional array to simulate the game's matrix.
And also because it's funny. Hopefully I don't have to explain why it is.
